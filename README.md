# ChatApp

https://github.com/zdean1/Chat-App

App will route to login page initially and will prompt to enter an email and password. If an incorrect email/password combination is entered, an error message will show up prompting to try again. The app will not route off the login page until a valid email/password combination is entered. 

Implemented log out button in the nav bar that will sign out of app and route back to the login page.
